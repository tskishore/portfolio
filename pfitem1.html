        <h2 class = "proj-subhead">What is Morse Code?</h2>
        <p>Morse Code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as
            standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes. The
            International Morse Code encodes the 26 English letters A through Z, and the numbers 0 to 9.
            There is no distinction between upper-case and lower-case letters. Each Morse code symbol is
            formed by a sequence of dots and dashes.</p>
            <p>The dot duration is the basic unit of time measurement in Morse code transmission. The
                duration of a dash is three times the duration of a dot. Each dot or dash within a character is
                followed by period of signal absence, called a space, equal to the dot duration. The letters of a
                word are separated by a space of duration equal to three dots, and the words are separated by a
                space equal to seven dots. To increase the efficiency of encoding, Morse code was designed so
                that the length of each symbol is approximately inverse to the frequency of occurrence of the
                character that it represents in text of the English language. Thus, the most common letter in
                English, the letter ‘E’, has the shortest code: a single dot. Because the Morse code elements are
                specified by proportion rather than specific time durations, the code is usually transmitted at
                the highest rate that the receiver is capable of decoding. The Morse code transmission rate
                (speed) is specified in groups per minute, commonly referred to as words per minute.</p>

        <h2 class = "proj-subhead">How This Project is Done</h2>
        <p>The project is designed to implement a system that translates the Morse Code to the
            English Alphabet(A-Z) and numbers (0-9). The Morse Code is given as the input to the FPGA
            through a single KEY. This KEY is configured to act as the sole input signal because the
            intention is to make this system similar to the traditional telegraph which has only one signal
            key to transmit electrical pulses. The given input code is translated or decoded into the English
            Alphabet and numbers. This conversion is done by the FPGA board with the help of the Verilog
            code dumped into it.</p>
        <p>The design consists of three modules. The first module takes the input Morse Signal
            and recognizes dots, dashes, space between the letters, space between the words, and feeds
            them to the second module. The second module, which is the top-level block, uses the first and
            third modules to decode the given Morse signal and display the decoded signal on the LCD
            screen, respectively. The third module is to encode the output of the second module so that it
            can be displayed on the LCD Screen. The third module is not necessary when the project is
            simulated with a ‘testbench’; it is only required during the hardware implementation of the
            project.</p>
